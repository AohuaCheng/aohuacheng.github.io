<p>Hello, world!</p>
<p>I am Aohua Alexander Cheng. This is my own website.</p>
<p>I have been considering setting up my own website for a while until I can't sleep on the train to Changsha, China for TOEFl. So I just do it.</p>
<p>Actually, my initial idea of building my own webpage is to get familiar with thinking and writing in English for I am ready to go abroad for P.H.D degree. As a person willing to devote myself to science, if I can't thinking philosophy in English, it will be useless for me to do real research abroad. </p>
<p>Anywayï¼ŒI hope to share all kinds of my opinions valuable worth of thinking. For example, I was just thinking about love, responsibility and mechanics of information encoding in our brain. So this website will be a complex record of my brain. Hope it will be interesting for you to read.</p>
<p>Moreover, I won't add comment function in my website. But you can contact me by my email aohuacheng@gmail.com. If our discussion is interesting, I will put it on my website.</p>
<p>Now, I am most interested in consciousness and neuroscience. I will attach my resume later.</p>
